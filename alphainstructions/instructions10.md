# Instructions 10: Hand tools for digging and planting

These are the first tools a new player buys, for small "housework" garden jobs. Jobs never
name the tool, so each one must be easy to recognize: players learn that a narrow blade with
depth marks is for bulbs, a scoop is for potting, and so on.

## Where this goes

- You're working in Roblox Studio on **Lawn Mowing Simulator**, a realistic lawn-care and gardening
  game for phones. It's owned by the **Big Dink Studios** group and edited in Team Create.
- Every mesh, texture and model you generate or upload must be **owned by Big Dink Studios**.
  Assets owned by anyone else won't load in the game.
- Put each finished model in **`ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Tools`**, named **exactly** as listed below. The names are item
  ids and are case-sensitive. The game finds each model by name and uses it in place of the gray
  block placeholder, so no code changes are needed.
- Only add the models in this file. Don't create or edit scripts. Don't change
  `ReplicatedStorage.Shared`, `ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Kit`, `ServerScriptService`,
  `StarterPlayer`, or any model already in `ReplicatedStorage.Assets`. Rojo syncs those from
  GitHub and would overwrite your edits.
- If a model with the same name is already in `ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Tools`, leave it alone and report it.
- Don't publish the game. The user publishes.

## Style

- The game aims to be **accurate**: model each item like the real thing, with true proportions
  and the details that tell one tool from another (a narrow blade vs. a scoop, bypass blades vs.
  an anvil, an air tire vs. a solid one). Players are meant to recognize tools by their looks.
- Match the Lawn Mowing kit already in `ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Kit` (for example
  `Mower_Push_21in` and `Prop_WheelieBin`): realistic, clean simple shapes, slightly worn but tidy,
  and easy to read on a phone screen.
- Unbranded: no logos, brand names or readable text anywhere.
- Scale: 1 stud = 0.28 m (1 inch = 0.09 stud, 1 foot = 1.09 studs). A player is about 5 studs tall.
- Phone performance: stay under each model's triangle budget. Use a few MeshParts rather than many
  tiny parts, and reuse one mesh for repeated pieces such as wheels. Don't add scripts, sounds,
  lights, particles or decals.

## How tools are held (every item in this file)

The game turns your Model into a Tool and puts the part named `Handle` in the player's right hand.
It also shows the item on storage racks and in the truck.

- Make each item a **Model** (not a Tool) that holds the visible parts plus one extra Part named
  exactly **`Handle`**: Size 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4, Transparency 1, Orientation (0, 0, 0), and
  CanCollide, CanTouch and CanQuery off.
- The Handle's center is the player's palm. Its up (+Y) is up, and its front (LookVector, −Z)
  points the way the player faces. So **pose the item the way it's used, with its working end
  toward −Z**, and put the Handle where a right hand grips it. The player's right is +X.
- Keep **real proportions**. In the holding pose the hand is about 4.3 studs above the ground and
  about 1.5 studs in front of the body. Pushed machines and ride-ons get their Handle at their real
  handlebar or controls; the game sets how high they sit so their wheels touch the ground.
- Set every part to Anchored on, with CanCollide, CanTouch and CanQuery off. The game unanchors
  and welds them itself. Leave the Model's pivot unrotated.
- The game animates moving parts automatically when you name them like this. This is optional,
  but it makes items feel alive:
  - A name containing `__Wheel` (two underscores, e.g. `<ItemId>__Wheel_FrontL`) rolls as the
    player moves, turning around **the part's own X axis**. Make the axle run along the part's X
    axis and center the part on the axle. Use it for wheels, reels, rollers and tine drums.
  - A name containing `__CutterRotor` or `__Spool` (e.g. `<ItemId>__CutterRotor_L`) spins while the
    item works, turning around **the part's own Y axis**. Center the part on its rotation point.
- For scale and Handle placement, look at the finished kit tools in
  `ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Tools` (`GasPushMower`, `RidingMower`, `GasTrimmer`, `OldRake`). Don't
  edit them.

## Models

### `HandTrowel` (Hand Trowel)

- A short **scoop-shaped stainless steel blade** (about 0.55 studs long, 0.3 wide, clearly dished)
  on a wooden or rubber grip. About **1.1 studs long** in total (12 in).
- Hold: Handle on the grip, blade pointing forward and angled down about 45°, like digging.
- Budget: 800 triangles.

### `HandTransplanter` (Hand Transplanter)

- Like a trowel, but the blade is **narrow and deep** (about 0.2 studs wide, 0.6 long), with
  **depth markings etched along it** (small raised or engraved lines for 1 to 6 inches; no
  numbers). About **1.2 studs long** (13 in).
- Hold: same as the trowel. Budget: 800 triangles.

### `HandCultivator` (Hand Cultivator)

- A short handle ending in **three curved steel claw tines**, spread like a small hand rake. About
  **1 stud long** (11 in). Dark gray tines rgb(120, 120, 130).
- Hold: Handle on the grip, tines pointing forward and curling down toward the ground.
- Budget: 800 triangles.

### `DandelionWeeder` (Dandelion Weeder)

- A long, thin steel shaft ending in a **V-shaped forked tip**, with a small curved fulcrum bump
  just behind the fork, on a wooden handle. About **1.3 studs long** (14 in).
- Hold: Handle on the grip, shaft pointing forward and steeply down, fork at the bottom.
- Budget: 600 triangles.

### `Dibber` (Dibber)

- A wooden **T- or D-handle** on a **pointed, tapered shaft** with a few depth rings around it. About
  **1 stud long** (11 in). Wood color rgb(150, 110, 70).
- Hold: Handle on the T or D grip, point straight down (−Y), like poking a planting hole.
- Budget: 600 triangles.

## Check your work

Run this with `execute_luau`, then compare the output with the expected values below.

```lua
local folder = game.ReplicatedStorage.Assets.Tools
for _, id in { "HandTrowel", "HandTransplanter", "HandCultivator", "DandelionWeeder", "Dibber" } do
	local model = folder:FindFirstChild(id)
	if not model then
		warn(id, "is missing")
		continue
	end
	local box, size = model:GetBoundingBox()
	local bottom = box.Position.Y - size.Y / 2
	local front = box.Position.Z - size.Z / 2
	local scripts, colliding = 0, 0
	for _, d in model:GetDescendants() do
		if d:IsA("LuaSourceContainer") then
			scripts += 1
		end
		if d:IsA("BasePart") and d.CanCollide then
			colliding += 1
		end
	end
	print(id, model.ClassName, "size", size, "scripts", scripts, "colliding parts", colliding)
	local handle = model:FindFirstChild("Handle")
	if handle and handle:IsA("BasePart") then
		print("   Handle invisible", handle.Transparency == 1, "facing", handle.CFrame.LookVector,
			"above bottom", handle.Position.Y - bottom, "reaches ahead", handle.Position.Z - front)
	else
		warn("   no Handle part")
	end
end
```

Expected for every item: class `Model`, scripts `0`, colliding parts `0`, Handle invisible `true`,
facing `0, 0, -1`.

- Every hand tool: size about 1–1.5 studs on its longest side.

Optional, while playtesting (`start_stop_play`): equip an item on the test player to see it held,
then take a `screen_capture`.

```lua
local Assets = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Assets)
local Tools = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Config.Tools)
local player = game.Players:GetPlayers()[1]
local humanoid = player.Character:WaitForChild("Humanoid")
local id = "HandTrowel" -- swap in each id from this file
local tool = Assets.tool(Tools.get(id).category, id)
tool.Parent = player.Backpack
humanoid:EquipTool(tool)
```

## Done when

- [ ] The check above matches the expected values.
- [ ] Every mesh and texture used is owned by Big Dink Studios.
- [ ] Nothing else in the place was changed.
